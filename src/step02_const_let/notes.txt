Understanding const and let in TypeScript

const Keyword

The const keyword in TypeScript is used to declare constants, which are variables whose values cannot be reassigned once they are initialized. Here's an explanation with examples:

// Use const where variable values do not change

const a = 5;
const b: number = 33;
const c = "best";

• Explanation:

o a = 5;: a is declared using const, so its value cannot be changed after initialization. Attempting to reassign a elsewhere in the code would result in a compilation error.
o b: number = 33;: b is explicitly typed as a number and initialized with 33. Like a, b cannot be reassigned.
o c = "best";: c is initialized with a string "best". As with a and b, c cannot have its value changed after initialization.

let Keyword

The let keyword in TypeScript is used to declare variables that have block scope, unlike var, which has function scope. Here's how let works:

// Use let instead of var everywhere, because let has block scope

if (true) {
let z = 4;
// Use z
} else {
let z = "string";
// Use z
}
console.log("let: " + z); // Error: z is not defined in this scope

• Explanation:

o Inside the if block, let z = 4; declares z with block scope, meaning z is only accessible within that block. The same applies to let z = "string"; inside the else block.
o Outside the blocks, attempting to access z results in an error (z is not defined) because z is scoped only within its respective if or else block.

Key Differences and Usage

• const vs let:
o Use const for variables whose values do not change throughout the program. This enhances code clarity and prevents accidental reassignment.
o Use let for variables that need to be reassigned or have block-scoped visibility within specific blocks of code.

Importance of const and let

• Code Safety: 

Using const ensures that constants retain their intended values, reducing accidental mutations and enhancing code reliability.

• Block Scope: 

let provides better scoping rules compared to var, reducing bugs caused by variable hoisting and unintended global scope.
